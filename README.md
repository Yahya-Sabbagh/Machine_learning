# Tumor Segmentation

This directory contains resources and pipelines related to tumor segmentation using machine learning techniques. It is organized to facilitate dataset preparation, preprocessing, exploratory analysis, and the conversion of labels for YOLO-based segmentation models.

## Structure

- **Dataset Preparation and YOLO Label Conversion Pipeline**  
  Scripts and notebooks for preparing datasets and converting segmentation labels into the YOLO format, enabling compatibility with YOLO-based segmentation models.

- **Data Preprocessing and Train-Test Split**  
  Tools and scripts for preprocessing medical images, normalizing data, and splitting datasets into training and testing subsets.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
  Notebooks and scripts for visualizing and analyzing the dataset to gain insights into image characteristics, label distribution, and segmentation challenges.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Yahya-Sabbagh/Machine_learning.git
   cd Machine_learning/Tumor Segmentation
   ```

2. **Explore the Pipelines:**  
   - Begin with the dataset preparation and label conversion scripts.
   - Use the preprocessing tools to clean and split your data.
   - Perform exploratory data analysis to better understand your dataset.

## Purpose

This project aims to streamline the tumor segmentation workflow, from raw data preparation to model-ready datasets, and provide robust scripts for data investigation and YOLO label generation.

## Contributions

Feel free to open issues or pull requests to improve any part of the pipeline or add new resources related to medical image segmentation.
