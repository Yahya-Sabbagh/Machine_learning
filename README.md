## How to Use

1. **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Yahya-Sabbagh/Machine_learning.git
    ```
2. **Install dependencies**  
   Most projects use Python libraries like `numpy`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn`. Install them using:
    ```bash
    pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
    ```
3. **Explore individual folders**  
   Each folder contains scripts or notebooks. Read the folder-specific README (if available) for more details.
